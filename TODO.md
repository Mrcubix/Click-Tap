## Plugin 

- [x] Bindings
- [x] Tablet Reference
- [ ] Handler
  - [x] Figure out a way to not just handle every aux buttons, on every reports. (Handler)
  - [ ] Plugin without PropertyValidatedAttribute should be supported (Bindings) (Semi-external)
  - [ ] When multiple properties are supported in OpenTabletDriver.External, we need to feed all settings (Bindings) (External)
- [x] Daemon

## UX

- [x] Same as OTD's Aux tab
- [ ] Fix Profiles not being updated directly
- [ ] Just rewrite the settings part, it's terrible
